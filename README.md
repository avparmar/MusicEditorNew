# MusicEditor

Hi.

This is a project made for CS3500, Object Oriented Design, at Northeastern University.

The purpose of this project was to create a working midi music player/editor and to demonstrate knowledge of OO concepts.

The use of a model-view-controller architecture is the foundation of the project. Take a look.
